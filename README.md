Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal data. The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview
Sonar is commonly used for object detection underwater. This project leverages a supervised learning algorithm to classify objects into two categories:
- R: Rocks
- M: Mines

The dataset consists of sonar signal readings, where each feature represents the intensity of sonar returns at different frequencies

Features of the Project
- Data Processing: Reads and processes the sonar dataset.
- Model Training: Implements logistic regression for classification.
- Evaluation: Measures accuracy using metrics from scikit-learn.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

Files in This Repository
- Rock vs Mine.ipynb: The main notebook containing code for data processing, training, and evaluation.
- Copy of sonar data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.



Dataset Details
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Format: CSV with 208 samples and 61 columns (60 features and 1 label)
- Labels:
  - R: Rock
  - M: Mine

Results
The logistic regression model achieves a high accuracy on the test dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in sonar-based object classification.

Future Improvements
- Experiment with more advanced machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forests).
- Apply feature selection techniques to improve performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Django.
